# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files

## Contents

- ### Package

    - [Package WindPlus](https://github.com/nitesh-1507/WindPlus): The statistical method covariate matching is rooted in deep literature. My current work as a Graduate Research Assistant on Industrial projects, paved way to script the method into a package. The code execution time has been reduced from 30 minutes to 20 seconds using C++.
    
- ### Algorithms from scratch

     - [Linear Regression](https://github.com/nitesh-1507/Linear-Regression): The implementation of linear regression from scratch has been highlighted, which includes gradient calculation and parameter update.
     
     - [Clustering Kmeans](https://github.com/nitesh-1507/Clustering-Kmeans): The vectorized implementation of Kmean clustering has been highlighted. The algorithm showcases the fundamentals of centroid initialization, and its update as the iteration proceeds.
    
    - [Logistic Regression Multiclass](https://github.com/nitesh-1507/Logistic-Regression-Multiclass): The implementation of multiclass logistic regression is highlighted, using newtons method. Unlike gradient descent, newtons method requires computing hessian matrix. The ridge penalty is further added in the objective function to make the inverse of hessian practical. clustering has been highlighted. The algorithm showcases the fundamentals of centroid initialization, and its update as the iteration proceeds.
     
     - [Lasso using coordinate descent](https://github.com/nitesh-1507/Lasso-Regession-using-coordinate-descent): The implementation of lasso regression, or L1 penalty for sparsity is highlighted. The gradient update is done using coordinate descent, which unlike gradient descent updates one coordinate at a time. 
     
     - [Lasso using C++](https://github.com/nitesh-1507/Lasso-Regression-using-Cpp): The lasso implementation using c++ in R shows significant speed improvement. The armadillo library eases the code implementation in C++, since it consists of easy operation using vectors and matrix.
